Q: What the heck is up with the map objects?

A: The pertinent map objects are submap, mapbuffer, map, and overmap.
The submap contains the actual map data, in SEEXxSEEY chunks.
   Vehicles and Spawns are stored in vectors because they're relatively sparse.
Submaps live in the single global mapbuffer, MAPBUFFER.
Map encapsulates the area around the player that is currently active.
   It contains an array of MAPSIZE * MAPSIZE submap pointers called grid.
      This is a 2D array, but is mapped to a 1D array for (questionable) indexing purposes.
   When the player moves from one submap to another, map::shift() is called.
      It moves the pointers in grid to keep the player centered.
      The leading edge of grid is populated by map::load()
         If the submap has been visited before, it's loaded from MAPBUFFER
         Otherwise a 2x2 chunk of submaps is generated based on the corresponding overmap square type.
An overmap encapsulates the large-scale structure of a map
   Such as location and layout of cities, forests, rivers, roads, etc...
   There are an arbitrary number of overmaps
   Additional overmaps are generated as the player enters new areas.
